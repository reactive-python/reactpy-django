SPECIAL_PROPS = r"""
children: A React node (an element, a string, a number, a portal, an empty node like null, undefined and booleans, or an array of other React nodes). Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like <div><span /></div>.
dangerouslySetInnerHTML: An object of the form { __html: '<p>some html</p>' } with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the innerHTML property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn't trusted (for example, if it's based on user data), you risk introducing an XSS vulnerability. Read more about using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
ref: A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.
suppressContentEditableWarning: A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you're building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually.
suppressHydrationWarning: A boolean. If you use server rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don't overuse it. Read more about suppressing hydration errors.
style: An object with CSS styles, for example { fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }. Similarly to the DOM style property, the CSS property names need to be written as camelCase, for example fontWeight instead of font-weight. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like width: 100, React will automatically append px (“pixels”) to the value unless it's a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don't know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient. Read more about applying CSS with className and styles.
"""

STANDARD_PROPS = r"""
accessKey: A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended.
aria-*: ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.
autoCapitalize: A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.
className: A string. Specifies the element's CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles.
contentEditable: A boolean. If true, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like Lexical. React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.
data-*: Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit="banana". In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.
dir: Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Specifies the text direction of the element.
draggable: A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API.
enterKeyHint: A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.
htmlFor: A string. For <label> and <output>, lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names (htmlFor) instead of HTML attribute names.
hidden: A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.
id: A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.
is: A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element.
inputMode: A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).
itemProp: A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers.

name: A string. Specifies the name for this input that's submitted with the form.
onChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled text areas. Fires immediately when the input's value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser input event.
onChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.
onInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.
onInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.
onInvalid: An Event handler function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles.
onInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.
onSelect: An Event handler function. Fires after the selection inside the <textarea> changes. React extends the onSelect event to also fire for empty selection and on edits (which may affect the selection).
onSelectCapture: A version of onSelect that fires in the capture phase.
placeholder: A string. Displayed in a dimmed color when the text area value is empty.
readOnly: A boolean. If true, the text area is not editable by the user.
required: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.
rows: A number. Specifies the default height in average character heights. Defaults to 2.
wrap: Either 'hard', 'soft', or 'off'. Specifies how the text should be wrapped when submitting a form.
"""

LINK_PROPS = r"""
disabled: a boolean. Disables the stylesheet.
onError: a function. Called when the stylesheet fails to load.
onLoad: a function. Called when the stylesheet finishes being loaded.
as: a string. The type of resource. Its possible values are audio, document, embed, fetch, font, image, object, script, style, track, video, worker.
imageSrcSet: a string. Applicable only when as="image". Specifies the source set of the image.
imageSizes: a string. Applicable only when as="image". Specifies the sizes of the image.
sizes: a string. The sizes of the icon.
href: a string. The URL of the linked resource.
crossOrigin: a string. The CORS policy to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials. It is required when as is set to "fetch".
referrerPolicy: a string. The Referrer header to send when fetching. Its possible values are no-referrer-when-downgrade (the default), no-referrer, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, and unsafe-url.
fetchPriority: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are auto (the default), high, and low.
hrefLang: a string. The language of the linked resource.
integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to verify its authenticity.
type: a string. The MIME type of the linked resource.
"""

META_PROPS = r"""
name: a string. Specifies the kind of metadata to be attached to the document.
charset: a string. Specifies the character set used by the document. The only valid value is "utf-8".
httpEquiv: a string. Specifies a directive for processing the document.
itemProp: a string. Specifies metadata about a particular item within the document rather than the document as a whole.
content: a string. Specifies the metadata to be attached when used with the name or itemProp props or the behavior of the directive when used with the httpEquiv prop.
"""

SCRIPT_PROPS = r"""
async: a boolean. Allows the browser to defer execution of the script until the rest of the document has been processed — the preferred behavior for performance.
crossOrigin: a string. The CORS policy to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials.
fetchPriority: a string. Lets the browser rank scripts in priority when fetching multiple scripts at the same time. Can be "high", "low", or "auto" (the default).
integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the script, to verify its authenticity.
noModule: a boolean. Disables the script in browsers that support ES modules — allowing for a fallback script for browsers that do not.
nonce: a string. A cryptographic nonce to allow the resource when using a strict Content Security Policy.
referrer: a string. Says what Referer header to send when fetching the script and any resources that the script fetches in turn.
type: a string. Says whether the script is a classic script, ES module, or import map.
