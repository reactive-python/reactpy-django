???+ summary

      Set up a **Django Project** with at least one app.

---

If you've reached this point, you should have already [installed Django-IDOM](../installation/index.md) through the previous steps.

For the examples within this section, we will assume you've placed the files [generated by `startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app) directly into your **Django project** folder. This is common for small projects.

??? question "How do I organize my Django project for IDOM?"

      Django-IDOM has no project structure requirements. Organize everything as you wish, just like any **Django project**.

??? question "I've never used Django, what do I need to learn?"

      {% include-markdown "../installation/index.md" start="<!--dj-proj-start-->" end="<!--dj-proj-end-->" %}

      Afterwards, make sure to follow the [Django-IDOM installation instructions](../installation/index.md).
