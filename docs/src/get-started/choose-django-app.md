## Overview

!!! summary "Overview"

      Set up a **Django Project** with at least one app.

## Choose a Django App

If you have reached this point, you should have already [installed ReactPy-Django](../get-started/installation.md) through the previous steps.

You will now need to pick at least one **Django app** to start using ReactPy-Django on.

For the examples within this section, we will assume you have placed the files [generated by `startapp`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app) directly into your **Django project** folder. This is common for small projects.

??? question "How do I organize my Django project for ReactPy?"

      ReactPy-Django has no project structure requirements. Organize everything as you wish, just like any **Django project**.
