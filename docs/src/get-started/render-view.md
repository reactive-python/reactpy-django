## Render Your View

Run the following command to start up the **Django** development webserver.

```bash linenums="0"
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can navigate to your **Django project** URL that contains an IDOM component, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/example/` (_from the previous step_).

If you copy-pasted our example component, you will now see your component display "Hello World".
