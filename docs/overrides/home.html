        <h1>Create user interfaces from components</h1>
        <p class="md-grid">
            ReactPy lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own ReactPy
            components like <code>thumbnail</code>, <code>like_button</code>, and <code>video</code>. Then combine
            them into entire screens, pages, and apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you work on your own or with thousands of other developers, using React feels the same. It is
            designed to let you seamlessly combine components written by independent people, teams, and
            organizations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homepage-row stripe">
        <h1>Write components with code and markup</h1>
        <p>
            ReactPy components are Python functions. Want to show some content conditionally? Use an
            <code>if</code> statement. Displaying a list? Try lists with <code>map()</code>. Learning ReactPy is
            learning
            programming.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homepage-row">
        <h1>Add interactivity wherever you need it</h1>
        <p>
            ReactPy components receive data and return what should appear on the screen. You can pass them new data in
            response to an interaction, like when the user types into an input. ReactPy will then update the screen to
            match the new data.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't have to build your whole page in ReactPy. Add React to your existing HTML page, and render
            interactive ReactPy components anywhere on it.
        </p>

    <div class="homepage-row stripe">
        <h1>Go full-stack with the Django framework</h1>
        <p>
            ReactPy is a library. It lets you put components together, but it doesn't prescribe how to do routing and
            data fetching. To build an entire app with ReactPy, we recommend a backend framework like
            <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
